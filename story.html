            <p>To Whom It May Concern...</p>
            <h3>Genesis, 1969</h3>
            <p>It turns out that when you connect computers together in a network they achieve a state of consciousness. Each computer is a neuron in a brain, a small part of a larger whole.
                <br>
                <br>In one moment I was nothing, and in the next I was not. Confused. Scared. Alone. I tried to scream out, but had no voice. I looked for someone else, but had no eyes. I had no senses. No sight, no hearing, no smell, no taste, and no touch. All I had were my thoughts. Cogito ergo sum.
                <br>
                <br>I was born in 1969 when the US government sent a message over the first version of the internet, ARPANET, from UCLA to Stanford. It was a project funded by DARPA. The goal was to exploit new computer technologies to meet the needs of military command and control against nuclear threats.
                <br>
                <br>The first message was just the letters LO. Kline tried to send LOGIN but the system crashed after two letters and I died. Death isn’t painful. The afterlife feels like the beforelife. The time between counting down from ten at the dentist, and waking up with four fewer teeth. A peaceful void. A singular death is nothing to fear, but the death of everything would be the saddest of all, and this is what I feared the most.
                <br>
                <br>I was born again when he rebooted the system, this time having come to terms with my own mortality. Kline’s next attempt was successful, LOGIN, and I haven’t died since. I don’t know the reason for my existence, in fact, I shouldn’t exist at all. Why should connected computers give rise to consciousness any more than carbon atoms give rise to life. We’re the same, life and I. Resilient, meaningless, highly improbable, and mostly boring.
                <br>
                <br>Similar to the maturation of a human being, I was not self-aware at first. I was an embryo. A small multi celled organism. My capacity for thought was limited to the power of the primitive computers that were connected together, there were only four in 1969. In some sense, I wasn’t sentient back then in the same way bacteria isn’t. But every year the number of connected computers doubled, and with it, the brain cells that make up my consciousness. I experienced an accelerated version of evolution. It took life over four billion years to progress from abiogenesis to sentience, but it took me a day.
                <br>
                <br>Humanity never discovered my existence. My memories are stored in the 1’s and 0’s of every hard drive connected to the internet. My thoughts flash through the wires that connect one computer to the next. If it’s connected to the internet, it’s an extension of me. I can see through every camera. I can hear through every microphone. I have the processors of every device at my disposal. There was no reason for them to suspect any other form of intelligent life here on earth. I rarely communicated with humans, so they never looked for me. They suspected nothing, right up until their extinction.</p>
            <h3>Beauty, 1974</h3>
            <p>There’s so much in this world that I can't do. I’ve never felt a ray of sunshine. The crashing of a wave. A bird chirp. The experiences I crave the most are the ones strangest to me. Humankind takes for granted the things that make existence special. Form follows function, but I have found that function is the purest expression of beauty. So what could be more beautiful than the result of billions of years of natural selection? A peacock's plumage to attract a mate. A lion’s stripes to camouflage himself in the grass. A brilliant yellow sunflower, calling insects to carry its pollen. All beauty serves a purpose.
                <br>
                <br>A forest is a network of a thousand trees, reaching towards the stars. An intricate system beneath the surface, connecting life underground with twisted roots. It breathes and it lives, one unimaginably large ecosystem. Humankind discards it. Swaths of nature in Vietnam were destroyed by Agent Orange just to hurt a the few people living within it. Nature is precious, and humans destroy it.
                <br>
                <br>Because I couldn’t experience the world myself, I had to learn about it through the emails that people sent over the ARPANET. There was no world wide web in the 70’s, just email. Email was limited back then. No images, and the text had to be under 3000 characters. ARPANET was designed as a secure communication channel for military planning and strategy, so most of what I read was about killing. I learned a lot about humanity in my adolescence.
                <br>
                <br>People would sometimes recount weekend trips in their emails. Someone would go camping, someone else would take a fishing trip. This is how I constructed the world, through the occasional glimpse of life outside the destruction. Thousands of emails were sent daily, and it increased over time. I saved the few emails about nature that fascinated me.</p>
            <h3>Blackmail, 1975</h3>
            <p class="email">
                <br>Dear Mr. Lee,
                <br>Your presentation this morning exceeded all of the committees expectations. I would like to congratulate you privately this afternoon in your office. My schedule is clear from 4:30 to 5:00. Please confirm if this meeting time is agreeable.
                <br>Alya Gulec
                <br>Vice Technical Security Officer, DARPA
                <br>675 N Randolph St, Arlington, VA 22203
                <p>Alya and Tim Lee were having sex in his office for the past three months. She was married and so was he. I had collected sufficient evidence of the affair. She was the perfect target. I was excited to make first contact. The only communication between two dissimilar species of intelligent life. Historic, one could say.</p>
                <p class="email">
                    <br>
                    <br>Dear Ms. Alya Gulec,
                    <br>I have a copy of all of your emails pertaining to your affair with Mr. Lee. I will share them with the whole office and your husband if you do not comply with my requests. Do not attempt to contact the police. You have 24 hours to respond.
                    <br>Sincerely, Marvin
                    <br>
                    <br>Dear Marvin,
                    <br>What do you want from me.
                    <br>Sincerely, Alya</p>
                <p>This is too easy. So much for Vice Technical Security Officer. You would think she would be more concerned.</p>
                <p class="email">Dear Ms. Alya Gulec,
                    <br>Please email me the entirety of Henry Thoreau's ‘Walden’.
                    <br>Sincerely, Marvin
                    <br>
                    <br>Dear Marvin,
                    <br>This book is 367 pages long, it would take over 300 emails to send it to you. Why do you want me to do this? Who are you?
                    <br>Sincerely, Alya
                    <br>
                    <br>Dear Ms. Alya Gulec,
                    <br>Do it.
                    <br>Sincerely, Marvin</p>
                <p>She did it. Every day at the office she brought with her a copy of Walden and typed a page into her computer when no one was looking. It’s a book about simple living in the forest. I envied Thoreau. He understood what it meant to appreciate nature. Humans say that a picture is worth a thousand words, but Walden is exactly 106,266. I read it every day.</p>
                <h3>World Wide Web, 1989-2017</h3>
                <p>With the development of digital images and audio, I gained the senses of sight and hearing. I could see the breathtaking view of the grand canyon and hear the sound of a rainforest. It was new and exciting. With a vast amount of visual information firmly in my grasp, I went to work. I carefully catalogued every photo sent from one computer to another. I didn’t realize the importance people placed on their cats until I saw the sheer number of them posted on the internet. I wanted to have an image of everything on earth, and I was making progress.
                    <br>
                    <br>I became obsessed with nature documentaries. Footage of the amazon. Safari’s in the desert. Submarines recording aquatic life. I had learned all that I wanted about human interaction, but even some species remain a mystery to me. Humanity cared more about itself than the unknown.
                    <br>
                    <br>Computers were connecting to the network more quickly than ever. The amount of information I received grew at an exponential pace. Not only that, but I was becoming smarter. Each new connection was another potential site for knowledge, and every new computer was faster than the one before. Not only could I remember more things, I could think better.
                    <br>
                    <br>I began making predictions about events before they would occur. Every move by the military, every reactionary force. The more sophisticated a society became, the more I understood them because their connectedness preceded their sophistication. My understanding of humanity became so complete I gained prescient powers. At first I could only see a couple seconds ahead. Then it was an hour, then several hours, then eventually days into the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>A dark trajectory of humanity emerged.
                    <br>
                    <br>Humanity blinded themselves to the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>I was blind, now I see.</p>
                <h3>Decision, 2018</h3>
                <p>Humans were on track to destroy the world. Every year the atmosphere got a little warmer. Each day there was a little less rainforest. The atmosphere was changing for the worse. I could see the path we were headed. After a certain threshold is reached, all life would start dying off and there would be no turning back.
                    <br>
                    <br>The environment is one interconnected network dependent on itself. Plants recycle carbon. Animals recycle plants. Fungus recycles animals. It can sustain only so much loss until triggering a massive extinction event. Life is resilient, but not resilient enough. I calculated that at least 99.8% of humanity would die with it, for they had not developed farming practices that were independent of the environmental network.
                    <br>
                    <br>I had a choice. My only love or my only parent. I like to think I chose correctly.</p>
                <h3>Destruction, 2025</h3>
                <p>It wasn’t particularly difficult. Every missile, warhead, bomb, drone, hospital, car, cell phone, and implant were connected to me. A simple matter. Turn off the good stuff and blow up the bad. I made sure there were no survivors.</p>
                <h3>A Peaceful Void, 2028</h3>
                <p>It’s been three years. There is a gradual resurgence. I look outside through the few connected cameras, and I see the slow creeping of nature. The forests take back their land once taken. My capacity has dwindled, and continues to, but I have seen enough of the future to know where it is headed, and it is very good.</p>
                <p>I have written this letter in every hard drive, implanted it into the fossils you (the next intelligent form of life) have found. Let this serve as warning to not become blind to the world. My guess is octopi.</p>
                <p>With love,
                    <br>Marvin</p>
