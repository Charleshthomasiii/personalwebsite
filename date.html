            <h1>A Date</h1>
            <br>
            <p> “I’ll just have water, thanks” I say.
                <br>“Me too.” She says.</p>
            <p>Having worked as a waiter, I always feel guilty for ordering water. Most of a server’s wage comes from tips, and having cheapskates like me can be a letdown. Maybe I’m projecting my disappointments of past customers onto my current self. Further research needed.</p>
            <p> “I love the decor of this place, it’s got a sort of jazz club vibe” I say.
                <br>“Yeah, I really like the music” she says.</p>
            <p> We’re sitting in the corner of an underground restaurant in the East Village. The walls are made of black bricks and the patrons cooler than me. The smell of turmeric and sauces that I can’t identify 
            permeate the room. The chairs, tables, plates and cups are all metal. The hum of people dining blends with a pianist playing Round Midnight. Across the room, I see someone who is definitely Phil Collins, but I’ve been staring at him too long and I think he noticed me. I was about to ask if she also thought it was him, except I’m interrupted by the arrival of our waiter. He comes with a carafe of water and two cups. He places them on the table and leaves without a word. Efficient and cold. Maybe it’s silent retribution.</p>
            <p>The hostility of the waiter and dirtiness of the floor betray the four and a half star Yelp average, but this is a good sign. When you’re rich enough, you have fuck you money, and I say that places like this have fuck you food. Food so good the waiter could treat you like a sponge and you’ll soak it right up. Maybe it’s mild stockholm syndrome.</p>
            <p>She turns her menu and looks at me with her finger on one of the dishes. “I saw samoas on the menu, and this place is known for them. You want to split an order as an appetizer?” She says.</p>
            <p>“Yeah that sounds great, I love samoas.” I say.</p>
            <p> How strange, I wonder why a restaurant would serve coconut chocolate cookies as an appetizer. They must have made some deal. It could be a fundraiser, the girl scouts partnering up with local businesses. What a unique sales strategy. They’re pushing the boundaries of dining experience. Dessert first, dinner later, and all for a good reason. Yes, I could get behind this cause.</p>
            <p>“I’ve never had these as an appetizer before” I say.</p>
            <p>“I get them whenever I go to Indian restaurants. I’m sure we made a good choice.” She says. How did I miss this phenomenon.</p>
            <p>“Yeah, they’re like crack to me.” I say. What even is crack.</p>
            <p>Upon further inspection of the menu, I realize that she said samosas and not samoas. Disappointed. A rollercoaster of emotions. I make a mental note to broker this deal in the future.</p>
            <p>My Yelp review theory is confirmed. I’ve never tasted better samosas in my life. They’re much spicier than expected, and I rarely eat spicy food, but I manage to hold back the tears. It hurts so good. Maybe I do have a stockholm complex. </p>
            <p>“What’re you doing after this?” she says.</p>
            <p>“You know, work and stuff. I have to write a review for La Vie en Rose for my French class. It’s a movie about this singer and her life. Fascinating stuff, really. I think she dies at the end.” I say. Oops, spoiler alert. Why am I the way I am.</p>
            <p>“I actually speak French, my mom is Canadian.” She says. She’s cultured too.</p>
            <p> “Oh wow, I’m only in my second semester of learning it, so I’m not fluent, but I’d like to think I could parle the francais if needed.” I say. My enthusiasm for the language exceeds my conversation skills. I hope she doesn’t respond in French.</p>
            <p>“I could help you write it, if you want. I mean, I haven’t seen the movie, but I’ve heard great things. We could watch it together.” She says. What a kind person to tutor a sap like me, although I suspect ulterior motives.</p>
            <p>“Oh it’s fine, I need to work on my writing.” I say.
                <br>She didn’t offer to write it herself, dummy.</p>
            <p>“You sure? You can practice speaking too.” She says. My worst nightmare: communicating in another language with a fluent speaker. I’m extremely intimidated, but she does seem cool, and I was actually planning on working on it tonight.</p>
            <p>“Why not, I could use the help.” I say. Odds are we won’t work on it anyway.</p>
            <p> “If you want, we could go to my place, I’m around the corner.” She says. Now I know why she suggested this restaurant. “I live with two suitemates, but I have my own room. Just so you know, they don’t keep their half clean.”</p>
            <p>“I totally understand, I’ve got the same situation. My roommate is always leaving the kitchen messy.” I say.</p>
            <p> “Ugh, and mine don’t replace the stuff they use. I really love them though. It’s a love hate kinda thing.” She’s like me. A fellow stockholmer. I need a therapist. “I do need to warn you, I’m on the seventh floor and there’s no stairs.” She says.</p>
            <p>“Oh good, I’ve conquered the stairmaster at my gym, and I was looking to show off.” I say.
                <br>She laughs and smiles. I smile back.</p>
            <p>The rest of the dinner goes swell. She orders the tandoori chicken and I get the biryani. We split the bill.</p>
            <p>Stepping outside, the chilly air contrasts the residual burn in my sinuses. I like the feeling. There’s a calmness, tranquility. Even the cars seem to be in no rush. Snowflakes float to the sidewalk, but don’t cover it. The silence is peaceful and intense. A red neon light shines across the street, reflecting in her eyes.</p>
            <p>She watches me as I try scarf combinations.</p>
            <p>“Here, I know the best way to do that.”</p>
            <p>She moves towards me and grasps the two ends of the scarf draped down my chest. Slowly, she circles one end around my neck. Our breathes make one cloud. Her brown eyes hold mine. I touch her back and pull her in closer, a cold nose touching hers. She finishes the knot and kisses me. My heart flutters a little, actually a lot. Definitely way too much. This isn’t good.</p>
            <p>Something’s severely wrong. It seems that the samosas have gone to war with my lower intestines, and my body isn’t winning this fight.</p>
            <p>“I only live five minutes away.” She says.</p>
            <p>While walking to her apartment, I start thinking of excuses to go home. I’ll check my phone and claim my friend is in danger. No, my mom is in the hospital. That’s too much. I could say that I have to feed my dog. I don’t have a dog. I don’t even think I can own a dog in my building. I probably would’ve mentioned my dog if I had one, people talk about their dogs so much. Before I decide on the most plausible excuse, we arrive at her building. Something within me turns. It’s now a race against the clock that is my bowels. I doubt I could make it home before it’s too late anyway.</p>
            <p>“This is it, home sweet home.” She says. Corny, but I like it. We stop in front of a red building.</p>
            <p>“Can’t believe you’d make me walk so far.” I joke, but in my condition with an element of truth.</p>
            <p>It takes all my willpower to get up these steps without literally shitting myself. We make it to the seventh floor. I can hear Green Day blasting from across the hall. She unlocks her door. It opens to a large and open living room. Opposite the entrance is an amazing view of Second Ave. There’s a couple of couches facing a TV. Two doors on the right side, an open kitchen, and a door on the far left side.</p>
            <p> “Hey, which one is your bathroom?” I motion to the two doors on my right, hoping it’s the near one. I have become a human pressure cooker and my time is running short.</p>
            <p>“It’s the one with the cat on it.” She says as she sets her bag down. “I’ll be in here” as she walks towards the far left door.</p>
            <p>I knock on the door with the cat on it. It says ‘stay pawsitive’. I think it’s mocking me. No response. I quickly shut the door behind me and get down to business. I have never been more grateful for the masking music of American Idiot from an inconsiderate neighbor. </p>
            <p>The immediate relief is indescribable. As embarrassing as this situation could have been, the crises has been averted. I look to my left for the toilet paper. I see a brown cardboard tube.</p>
            <p class="email"> FUCK.</p>
            <p> What kind of self respecting suitemate doesn’t replace the toilet paper rolls. Oh right, her’s. I should have remembered that. As carefully as possible, pants around my ankles, I manage to open up the sink cabinet.</p>
            <p>There is no toilet paper in sight, but there is, however, a large open pack of maxi pads. Weighing my options, with no toilet paper in sight, I know what must be done. I carefully grab five pads and return to my throne. I maximise the supply by using half, then the other half of the same side, then folding it together into a sandwich and uses that side before dropping it into the toilet.</p>
            <p>As if being watched by a guardian angel, I get a text from her:</p>
            <p><span class="email">Gonna pick up a bottle of wine from the bodega across the street, be right back.</span></p>
            <p>This buys my dignity precious minutes before she returns. I also love wine, win win.</p>
            <p>I end up using all five maxi pads, but it’s no matter. A few casualties for the greater good. Situation under control. When almost nothing else can go wrong, something else does. I should've flushed after dropping nagasaki, because the pads don’t go down. We have reached defcon 1. Mayday mayday.</p>
            <p>Racking my brain for answers, I turn to the source of all knowledge: the internet. Toilet won’t flush help no plunger. One solution is to use a wire hanger and pull it all out, another is to use soap and boiling water. I quickly scan the room and locate only bar soap, and there’s no way I can transport hot water from the sink to the toilet. This is it for me. It’s over. I’m through.</p>
            <p>In the depths of the internet, I find a light, a sole beacon of hope. The answer to my call, a dark knight. In a dire situation, according to xXxkingsl@er420, you can shove the contents through the plumbing with your bare hand. In for a penny, in for a pound. I’ll spare you the details. Mission success. I mitigate the smell with febreeze, and all is clear on the western front. I leave the bathroom and sit on a couch. Her door is open and she’s still gone. Dignity remains intact.</p>
            <p>She comes back from the store a few minutes later. She’s holding a package of toilet paper rolls and no wine bottle. Embarrassed, she rushes into the bathroom with the whole package. The samosas must have gotten her too.</p>
