        <h1>Insights from a Lawn Chair</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered, 
            <br>Why geese fly in a V shape?
            <br>And when they do,
            <br>Often one side is longer than the other.
            <br>There's more geese on that side.
        </p>

        <p>
            Flies are flying insects
            <br>Bumblebees, bumbling bees
            <br>Hummingbirds are birds humming
            <br>Dragonflies, long scary flies
            <br>Ladybirds aren’t birds at all,
            <br>Or ladies
        </p>

        <p>
            If a picture is worth a thousand words,
            <br>Can I sell pictures of a calculus textbook
            <br>And quit my job
        </p>

        <p>
            Kudos to the early humans,
            <br>Who discovered the mushrooms that taste great
            <br>And the ones that kill you
        </p>

        <p>
            If grass could talk,
            <br>Would it ask us to continue cutting its hair,
            <br>Or accuse us of mass genocide
        </p>
            
        <h1> Some Haikus</h1>
        <p>
            Cucumbers are just
            <br>The part of watermelon
            <br>That nobody eats
        </p>

        <p>
            Spicy is to heat
            <br>As mint is to cold, so what
            <br>Does that make sour

        </p>

        <h1>Insights from a Small Boat</h1>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
        	The most ironic death:
        <br>Dehydration at sea. 
        <br>Surrounded by water,
        <br>But filled with salt.</p>
        

        <p>At what point does a pile of rocks
        <br>Cease to be rocks.
        <br>And exist as sand.</p>

        <p>A naval battle,
        <br>The only time a boat is
        <br>Under fire, over water, on fire, taking in water
        <br>All at the same time.</p>

       <p>How can we claim
        <br>Humans are smarter than dogs.
        <br>Mine understands a few English words.
        <br>I don’t know any barks.</p>

        <p>Seagulls are just
        <br>Rats of the sky.
        <br>Except bigger, flying, and more aggressive.</p>
        
        <p>Unicorns are to horses,
        <br>As narwhals are to whales,
        <br>Except one is real.</p>

        <p>I think the people
        <br>Who name creatures got to the ocean last.
        <br>Because they’re thoroughly uncreative.
        <br>Starfish, shellfish, jellyfish. 
        <br>None of these are even fish.

        <p>Seeing the hull of a ship pass above,
        <br>George, the fish, turns to his wife Wanda.
        <br>“I have a floating feeling in my stomach.”</p>

        <br>
        <br>
